# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# frontend-vonzu-test

## Exercice

At Vonzu Tech. we are releasing a new functionality related with our expeditions.

We need a landing page that given a reference search we display both its expeditions and client information.

## Requirements

### Technical requirements

- You will have to build an web application using React.js framework and typescript.

- You can implement your own CSS or use a UI components library.

- Reference search must be handled by an input.

- The sorting options are up to you, only one is necessary.

- You should spend between 3 and 5 hours working on this.

- We will use the code you deliver to us for the pair programming step of the interview process.

- You will find a `.json` file. You should treat it as if it were returned by an endpoint.

### Technical requirements

- In case we cannot implement all the needs, we would like to know the reason.
- The reference.png is an orientative mockup, you can apply your personal UI, and no icons are necessary.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
